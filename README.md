# NCC_HELPER_APP
This project is for NCC (National Cadets Corps) it’s not only for cadets; it’s for Commanding Officers, ANOs. This app is going to digitalize the work which is still being done on pen and paper.
It will consists a Splash Form where title of the project and developer name will be given, and then a Login Page will be shown in which three button will be shown CO Login, ANO Login, Recruitment Form.
If CO will login through his user id, password he/she will be able to see the status of respective colleges.
If ANO will login through his user id, password he/she can see the status of his cadet’s attendance, performance, he/she will be authorized to edit the profile of cadets.
When cadet will click on recruitment form button he/she will be redirected to a page where he/she can fill his detail along with that he/she have to upload his/her photo with thumb impression of herself and parents.

Existing System:-
So currently in NCC everything is done on paper or we can say it that it’s manual process, because of which there are so many bugs, Let’s start from the recruitment process of the cadet, he have to fill the form then that form data copied into ANO’s register then into an excel sheet, then when parade is being held 75% attendance of the total cadet is compulsory, and 90% attendance of a cadet in a year is compulsory to become eligible for B or C certificate exam, if any college will fail to meet this requirement of 75% the unit has the right to take NCC from that college, but since attendance is taken manually many times ANO’s ask to mark attendance of some absent cadets to meet the 75% requirement, because of this government money is going in waste, because for a single parade every cadet get the refreshment of 36/-. So with the help of this app attendance system will be biometrics.
Now when camps are held or when social activity are going to happen then again cadets volunteer for that but currently what happen is that, cadet send the message to the whatsapp group then on the basis of that again nominal form in excel sheet is prepared.
During camps again a form is filled then again that data is uploaded in excel sheet.

Proposed System:-
This app will computerize some of the process of NCC which is still done on pen and paper. Biometric attendance, one click nominal roll preparation.
Commanding officer can see the status of individual college, ANO’s will be allowed to see the attendance status of cadets and update their detail, and cadets will be able to register themselves in NCC.
Features:
	CO can see the individual college status and other details.
	Biometric attendance
	ANO’s login to see the status of cadets and allow to update their details
	ANO can remove any cadet on one click.
Function & Performance:
	CO, ANO will be able to see the status of particular college and individual cadets, along with the permission of updating their details.
	It will ease the attendance system with the aim to reduce proxy and easy preparation of nominal roll.
